# Divergence Meter

Android divergence meter widget like that in Steins;Gate.

Should support from Android 5 to 15. Releases in 2021 supported Android 4.1 and had a
different package name, so app may be duplicated. Only notification permission is optionally
required for displaying notifications since Android 13.

### Features

- Displaying divergence number in nixie tubes.
- 6 attractor fields: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omega.
- Balanced random system, that lowers the chance of going to another attractor field.
- Automatically update the divergence how often you want.
- Ability to set divergence to your own value.
- Notifications, when changing attractor field and for known worldlines.

### Issues

For any issues that are not consistent - readd widget or reinstall app, noting down your current
divergence to restore it later (sorry for such instability). For consistent issues - open an
issue and/or contact me.
